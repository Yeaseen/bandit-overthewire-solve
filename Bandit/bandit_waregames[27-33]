ssh bandit27@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

you can't clone the git repo on bandit27'd home.

create a folder in /tmp

mkdir foo

cd /tmp/foo

bandit27@bandit:/tmp/foo$ git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo

Previous line will not work. You have to specify port no which is 2220 as bandits are active on this port

bandit27@bandit:/tmp/foo$ git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo

cd repo
ls 
cat README

ssh bandit29@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

download the git repo first, just like previous level. DON'T FORGET TO PUT THE PORT NUMBER

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc$ git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo

cd repo

git log and git status all are ok.. there's no leak.
BUT, there might other branches that leaks the info

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git branch -a

you might see there is another branch 'dev'

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git checkout dev

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ ls
code  README.md

But both have nothing. We might guess that the leak is in the initial commits

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git log
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.gLklDEvFBc/repo$ git show 2b1395f00cfb986163082c50100be5be8f249f64

bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.DywL2LwOM5$ git clone ssh://bandit30-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit30-git/repo

git status, git diff, git diff --stage, git branch -a all of them are useless here.


Git tagging is a way to mark specific points in the history of the repository. One example would be to mark release points of the software. The command to see the tags is git tag. 

To create a tag the command is git tag -a <tag_name> -m <"tag description/message">. To see more details, like the tag message and commit, you can use the following command: git show <tag_name>.

bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.DywL2LwOM5/repo$ git tag
secret
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.DywL2LwOM5/repo$ git show secret

Just follow the instructions of the README file

create a key.txt file, write the content, push to the origin from master branch.

VOILA, after staging and commiting, you will see there's no change in the working tree.

Then watch out the .gitignore guy, he is a cultprit. remove the content of the .gitignore file.
then add, commit, push.

So everything we type seems to be made uppercase which is not the usual case in terminal shell.

The only things in Linux that are uppercase is variables. Specifically, the variable $0 has a reference to a shell. You can see this with echo $0 on your machine.

$whoami
bandit33

wow, that means this sh is owned by bandit33
so print the pass form etc/bandit_pass/bandit33

$cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
